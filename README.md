* Use SHA256 to create the hash for newly created blocks
* Add method to check if chain is valid (blocks are chained correctly using the block hashes)
* Update one block data in the chain and verify that the chain is not valid
* Recaculate the affected chain hashes so that the chain becomes valid again
